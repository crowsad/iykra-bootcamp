It’s harder to notice than gravitational time dilation.<p>&gt; easy via fields<p>Only for people who find non-Euclidian geometry that mixes time and space and is defined by a bunch of 4x4 tensors to be “easy”.<p>&gt; [particles bad fields good]<p>“Particle” is a convenient human-scale name for things, but everything’s fields these days anyway. Even the Higgs.<p>In fact, GR is field-only — it’s QM which says “by the way, those things you call particles are a certain type of excitation in a field” and “if the gravity field has a particle it must be a massless spin-2 boson, also every massless spin-2 field is indistinguishable from gravity”.<p>&gt; doesn’t explain dark matter<p>Doesn’t need to. It says there’s something to look for. GR is “stuff does X”, the observation is “X”, so there must be stuff. We’re can’t see stuff, but GR doesn’t say we have to be able to see it.<p>&gt; fast rotating magnets<p>I don’t know what you’re referring to, the closest pattern I am matching your words to is Podkletnov whose work was never reproducible by third parties, and you can bet SpaceX will have tried.<p>&gt; better gravity field theories out there, but they are lacking experimental verification<p>Science doesn’t use verification, it uses falsification. When an hypothesis can’t be falsified even in principle it isn’t science; when it can but only in principle, it’s a hypothesis; when it has been tested and the attempt to falsify it results in evidence that persistently doesn’t falsify it to a standard of statistical significance, then it gets published and perhaps elevated to the level of “theory”.</span>\n",

However, I would easily pick vuejs (or any comparable component based web framework) over winforms. Having maintained legacy VB apps with multiple 5000+ line forms, inscrutable multidirectional event chaining, and tangled up business logic and view logic, I&#x27;ve become a huge fan of forced separation of concerns.<p>The big problem is that there is much more of a learning curve. The first useful software I wrote used VB6 and winforms. Getting started was easy and intuitive, with a gentle learning curve. With virtually no experience, I was making neat things in hours. Within days I was making full applications. That says something about the power of that platform.<p>To be truly effective with modern web development took me a year or so. That was after years of professional experience.<p>At this point I can build web applications faster than I can build desktop software, but it took a huge time investment to reach this point, and I had to build multiple tools to make it possible.<p>I agree that there&#x27;s a niche that needs filling. I want all the benefits of modern web development, and I want a learning curve like VB6 with Access.</span>\n",

It would be really dangerous against any normal non tank vehicle in short ranges. Against a tank it&#x27;s useless nowadays. But the semi militarized armored cars used by some police forces would be disabled rather easily with one. Not blown up to smithereens, but a hit to the engine space would wreck that or a hit to the passenger compartment would kill some if not all inside.<p>Not that good against a building. A hand-grenade would do way more harm inside. So it&#x27;s more of a trophy thing, or a really nasty surprise against SWAT truck assuming the culprit manages to hit with it.<p>The lax security Australia has towards these is rather hilarious.</span>\n",

When an hypothesis can’t be falsified even in principle it isn’t science; when it can but only in principle, it’s a hypothesis; when it has been tested and the attempt to falsify it results in evidence that persistently doesn’t falsify it to a standard of statistical significance, then it gets published and perhaps elevated to the level of “theory”.\n",

      "                  I have a good amount of experience with both winforms and modern web development. I would pick winforms over vanilla html and js. However, I would easily pick vuejs (or any comparable component based web framework) over winforms. Having maintained legacy VB apps with multiple 5000+ line forms, inscrutable multidirectional event chaining, and tangled up business logic and view logic, I've become a huge fan of forced separation of concerns.The big problem is that there is much more of a learning curve. The first useful software I wrote used VB6 and winforms. Getting started was easy and intuitive, with a gentle learning curve. With virtually no experience, I was making neat things in hours. Within days I was making full applications. That says something about the power of that platform.To be truly effective with modern web development took me a year or so. That was after years of professional experience.At this point I can build web applications faster than I can build desktop software, but it took a huge time investment to reach this point, and I had to build multiple tools to make it possible.I agree that there's a niche that needs filling. I want all the benefits of modern web development, and I want a learning curve like VB6 with Access.\n",

However, I would easily pick vuejs (or any comparable component based web framework) over winforms. Having maintained legacy VB apps with multiple 5000+ line forms, inscrutable multidirectional event chaining, and tangled up business logic and view logic, I've become a huge fan of forced separation of concerns.<p>The big problem is that there is much more of a learning curve. The first useful software I wrote used VB6 and winforms. Getting started was easy and intuitive, with a gentle learning curve. With virtually no experience, I was making neat things in hours. Within days I was making full applications. That says something about the power of that platform.</p><p>To be truly effective with modern web development took me a year or so. That was after years of professional experience.</p><p>At this point I can build web applications faster than I can build desktop software, but it took a huge time investment to reach this point, and I had to build multiple tools to make it possible.</p><p>I agree that there's a niche that needs filling. I want all the benefits of modern web development, and I want a learning curve like VB6 with Access.\n",

I've actually shot a live one during my mandatory time at the military as a practice shot (We destroy our aging stock by making conscripts shoot them as a training exercise).<p>As a weapon it's the typical shaped charge warhead. It would be really dangerous against any normal non tank vehicle in short ranges. Against a tank it's useless nowadays. But the semi militarized armored cars used by some police forces would be disabled rather easily with one. Not blown up to smithereens, but a hit to the engine space would wreck that or a hit to the passenger compartment would kill some if not all inside.</p><p>Not that good against a building. A hand-grenade would do way more harm inside. So it's more of a trophy thing, or a really nasty surprise against SWAT truck assuming the culprit manages to hit with it.</p><p>The lax security Australia has towards these is rather hilarious.\n",
